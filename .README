# Course: Full Stack Engineer Program

# Personal Portfolio Webpage with CSS Grid
Author: Luis Enrique González Sánchez

# About a Project
This is a portfolio with 5 sections
-Header
-  About me
- Skills
- Projects
-Contact

The design uses a lot of black white and teal and is full responsive.

At the top I made a responsive navigation bar in the header
Group two About Me sections
Skills in a section called header-top and we made it responsive
using flexbox to group it in a column for mobile
Later in the projects section we made some cards with 3 cards per line
and for mobile a card that occupies 100%
finally add a contact section
with 2 inputs and a text area along with their label tags to describe
each field for mobile, the input and the textarea occupy 100% and the label tag disappears
